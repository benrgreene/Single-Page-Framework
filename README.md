# Single Page App Framework

This is an SPA CMS framework. It is designed to be a customizable framework, having some similar concepts to populare CMSs like WordPress, such as themes. 

While the backend is PHP powered, and themes **could** create the site through PHP, the majority of the framework is devoted to the API and a database interface, not template building - meaning there aren't tools in place to help much with templating in PHP. 

For example, the default theme uses React/Redux, so the (default) APIs don't even send HTML content back, but raw JSON objects for React to parse and display.

Check out the both [repository wiki page](https://github.com/benrgreene/Single-Page-Framework/wiki/Setting-Up-A-Site) for more info on the different aspects of the framework, as well as the [documentation micro-site](https://docs.benrgreene.com/)



I'll also note that I've left the build files/scripts in the repo, so that you can make updates/PR's as you see fit.

It is currently under construction, so star/follow for updates.
